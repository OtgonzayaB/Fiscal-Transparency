# Does Fiscal Transparency Reduce Capital Flight During Financial Crises in Emerging Economies?

This repository contains the data and code used for the empirical analysis presented in my thesis.

### Aim:
This study investigates whether higher fiscal transparency reduces sovereign risk premia during periods of financial stress in emerging economies. 

### Sample:
Focusing on 26 emerging markets and two major crises (2011 and 2015), the analysis combines market-based risk premia measures with macroeconomic and institutional indicators, using the Open Budget Index (OBI) as a proxy for fiscal transparency.
